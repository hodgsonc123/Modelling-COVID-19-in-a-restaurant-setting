Abstract

Problem: Studies show that the large majority of COVID-19 cases originate from indoor 
spaces, primarily due to poor ventilation, overcrowding and prolonged exposure. This project 
focuses on testing the effectiveness of different safety measures in their ability to reduce the 
risk of virus transmission through aerosols, droplets, and fomites. The SARS-Cov-2 virus thrives 
in closed spaces like restaurants, classrooms, and offices, where virus-laden aerosol particles 
can remain in the air for several hours, and close contact is frequent. 
By looking at the data on COVID-19 cases, a large spike known as 'the second wave' appears 
to occur shortly after restaurants reopened following a lengthy lockdown. It has been argued 
that the 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme encouraging people to dine at restaurants might have 
contributed to this. Before reopening restaurants, more research must be done to reduce 
indoor transmission risk further and prevent another spike in cases.

Objectives: This project aims to create a computer simulation to capture the complexity of 
virus transmission in a restaurant environment. By modelling the likes of ventilation, human 
behaviour, and various other safety measures, the simulation is intended to be used as a tool 
to aid research into their effectiveness at reducing COVID-19 transmission. 
Using the simulation to research each safety measure's effectiveness, we can estimate how 
large an impact it will have. It will help answer questions such as what effect does employing
the proper air change rate in a restaurant have on the number of cases produced? Or how 
large an impact does limiting restaurant capacity have on reduction in infections?

Methodology: The simulation was created in the agent-based modelling software Netlogo. 
The model is composed of four main sub-models: the spatial sub-model: capturing the 
restaurant environment such as seating configurations and the network of nodes forming the 
pathways through the restaurant, the movement sub-model: handling action scheduling and 
movements of waiters and customers in the restaurant, the infection sub-model: simulating 
the virus emission of an infected person, virus intake/infection risk of a healthy person and 
the different precautions a person can take such as mask-wearing, and finally the ventilation 
sub-model: which representsthe removal of aerosol particles from the air through mechanical
and natural ventilation. The simulation parameters are controlled through a simple user 
interface allowing the investigation of a single or combination of multiple safety measures. 
The data output from the model was analysed in excel to assess each safety measure 
effectiveness. 

Achievements: This project's objectives were achieved successfully by creating a simulation 
that captures how COVID-19 is transmitted from person to person in a restaurant setting. This 
includes transmission through viral aerosol particles, respiratory droplets, and fomites. The 
simulation also allows for COVID-19 safety measures such as physically distanced tables and 
face masks to be implemented. The output data can be analysed to gauge how effective a 
safety measure was, based on how significantly it reduced probable infections and infection 
risk. A combination of safety measure can also be tested to create the greatest reduction in 
infection risk.
